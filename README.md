# Financial time series analysis at Lightbox
## Project description
The code in this repository is the result of our secondment work at Lightbox Technologies SA.

### Secondment summary
Lightbox Technologies SA provides consultancy, research and development of hardware and software infrastructures, algorithms, mathematical and statistical models, aimed at the acquisition, maintenance, processing and analysis of massive volumes of data (big data), and the optimization of decision-making and production processes of third-party entities.
The secondment work focussed on the application of machine learning tools to financial time-series data, through the development of AI systems for predictive analysis using historical market data time series for a multitude of financial instruments. 
The objective of the secondment was to gain experience in the utilisation of modern machine learning models in the context of real-world predictive analysis. 

The secondment contained an extensive process of trial and error to make the algorithms more robust. Algorithmic biases were prevented by dividing the time series in training and testing periods. A Transfer Learning technique was employed in order to improve the training of the model by combining data from different securities to compensate for the limited availability of historical data. The training sample was identified by selecting datasets showing similar statistical features. The model provides market values predictions with associated uncertainties that can be compared with actual market results

The progress of the project was characterised by the application of increasingly complex and powerful machine learning methods, from classical boosted decision trees to a combination of Bayesian and recurrent neural networks, with each attempt steering subsequent model designs. An important/defining part of the problem was the model adapting to changing and often turbulent market conditions. In comparison to other ML applications the models are susceptible to going “out-of-date” quickly - thus presenting challenges to ML practitioners’ choices of training/validation data.

This repository contains part of the results produced during the secondment period.
